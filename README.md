### Hey there! 👋

I’m **Roberto**, a computer science student from Peru.

I like building practical things and learning by doing.

If I don’t fully understand something, chances are I’ll break it down, rebuild it, and document the process.

My main focus right now is **Python**, **Excel**, and **Data analysis**, with a growing interest in **AI and Machine learning**.  
I care a lot about clean logic, readable code, and solutions that actually make sense in the real world.

<!--
I’m actively uploading projects to GitHub to showcase my skills and growth — especially things related to automation, data handling, and problem-solving.

Long term, I want to work on products that use **AI** in meaningful ways, not just flashy demos.

If you’re curious, check out my pinned repositories — they represent what I can do *right now* (and I’m improving constantly).

#### Fun Facts:

* I’m improving my English by building and speaking in public
* I run a YouTube channel where I learn and explain things
* I like well-done functions with clean logic
* **Hobbies:** gym, learning, building projects, anime
